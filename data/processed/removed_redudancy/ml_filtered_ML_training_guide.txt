Machine Learning Training Guide
==============================

Dataset Overview:
- Total sequences: 17429
- Homology filtered at 30% similarity

Recommended Dataset Splits:
1. Training (70%): ~12200 sequences
2. Validation (15%): ~2614 sequences  
3. Test (15%): ~2614 sequences

Next Steps:
1. Use ml_filtered_non_redundant.fasta for your ML pipeline
2. Consider additional filtering based on sequence length if needed
3. Shuffle sequences before splitting into train/val/test sets
4. Monitor for potential data leakage in your specific domain

Quality Checks:
- Verify no sequences in test set are similar to training set
- Check sequence length distribution
- Validate that removed sequences don't contain critical examples

Commands to split dataset:
# Shuffle and split (using seqkit or similar tools)
seqkit shuffle ml_filtered_non_redundant.fasta > shuffled.fasta
seqkit split -p 3 shuffled.fasta  # Creates 3 roughly equal parts
