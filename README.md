# Signal Peptide Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of amino acid sequences and/or the contained individual amino acids into various different categories related to signal peptide types and residue locations using various machine learning models.

## Classification Tasks

- **2-state:**  
  - `0`: Non signal peptide  
  - `1`: Signal peptide

- **4-state:**  
  - Non signal peptide  
  - `S`: Sec/SPI  
  - `L`: Sec/SPII  
  - `T`: Tat/SPI and Tat/SPII

- **6-state:**  
  - `I`: Intracellular  
  - `M`: Membrane  
  - `O`: Extracellular  
  - `S`: Sec/SPI  
  - `L`: Sec/SPII  
  - `T`: Tat/SPI and Tat/SPII
